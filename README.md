# PowerShell Anchor-Api Module
PowerShell module for managing Axcient Anchor via the v2 API

🌟 ***Now with filesystem navigation***

Functions are PS-friendly, returning objects and accepting pipeline input where possible, including collections of objects.

# Usage

Download the files in the Anchor-Api folder to a folder named Anchor-Api, in your $env:PSModulePath (usually %userprofile%\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules, or C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules, or C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\).

Run `Import-Module Anchor-Api` to import the functions into your current session.
To see the list of available commands, use `Get-Command -Module Anchor-Api`.
`Get-Help <command-name>` returns helpful info in some cases.
Look at Anchor-BackupCheck.ps1 for examples.

# Functions

## Authentication functions 🔑

✅ Get-AnchorOauthState

   Returns the state of the current Oauth token

✅ Get-AnchorOauthToken

✅ Set-AnchorOauthToken

  Manually set the Oauth token for the current session to prevent the need to authenticate again if you already have a valid token from another session.

# Comments
- I know I'm onto something when I can write a statement like these, and they work: 

`PS> get-anchororg -top | Get-AnchorOrgChildren | where name -match "little" | get-anchororgshares | where name -match "Sync" | Get-AnchorOrgShareSubscribers -IncludeFromGroup -Raw`

`PS> Get-AnchorOrg -Top | Get-AnchorOrgChildren | ? name -Match "International" | Get-AnchorOrgRoots | ? name -EQ 'IGC Common Files' | Get-AnchorRootFilesModifiedSince -Since (Get-Date('2020-01-24 00:00')).ToUniversalTime()`
